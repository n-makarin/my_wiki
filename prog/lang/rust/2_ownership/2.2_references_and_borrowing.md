## References

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

References allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.

üîπ The opposite of referencing by using & is *dereferencing*, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`.

Because reference does not own variable, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope.

## Borrowing

**borrowing** - function with references as a parameters

We won‚Äôt need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

üîπ Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We‚Äôre not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

// error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*some_string` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
```

## Mutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

üî∏ But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope.

This code will fail:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

    // error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
}
```

The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A *data race* is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There‚Äôs no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not simultaneous ones:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
}
```

‚ùóÔ∏è We can't combine mutable and immutable references to once variable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```
