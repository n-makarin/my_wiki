**Crates** may be binary or liblary.

**crate root** - is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate.

**package** - is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality.
A package contains a *Cargo.toml* file that describes how to build those crates.

A package **must** contain zero or one library crates, and no more. It can contain as many binary crates as youâ€™d like, but it must contain at least one crate (either library or binary).

If a package contains *src/main.rs* and *src/lib.rs*, it has two crates: a library and a binary, both with the same name as the package.
